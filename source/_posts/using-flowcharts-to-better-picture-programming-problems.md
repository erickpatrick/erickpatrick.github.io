## TL;DR;

In this post we see how stopping a little bit to think and then diagraming a problem using flowchart can help in its understand. Also, we see a little bit of the most basic and used flowchart shapes.

## What is it and what is it worth for?

More often than not, with a programming task in hand directly start typing code into an IDE without properly thinking. By using Test Driven Development we may end up with a well thought solution. However, there are times that even with TDD we need something else to help in a task.

For those times pen and paper come really handy, but there is another thing that helps a lot: flowcharts. Flowcharts are a diagram type used to depict flows of processes, work, algorithms, etc.

Though hard to master, they are pretty straight forward to create. With only 4 or 5 shapes, we can create a really great variety of flows for our needs.

We will briefely see those shapes and some others as well. We will also see some alternatives to flowcharts so you can see what can be used for you and your projects.

## Alternatives

### Activity diagram
### Control flow graph

## Flowchart shapes

### Basic

#### Start
#### End
#### Decision
#### Process

### Extra shapes

#### Database
#### Internal storage
#### Off-page reference

## Example
